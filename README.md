# Saintcon2020
This is the year of minibadges. If you've ever wanted to make your own minibadge but thought it was too hard or too expensive, this is the badge for you. Not only does the badge hold more minibadges than any previous badge (17!), it comes with the parts for a minibadge and a gift certificate to have 3 copies of your own minibadge design produced! How awesome will it be to bring your very own minibadge to Saintcon next year! You'll even have a couple extras to trade with others!

The badge comes as a soldering kit, with all the tiny surface mount parts already soldered for you. Included in the badge kit are the parts for your own minibadge (pins, resistors, and LEDs). Having pre-selected parts will take a lot of the guesswork out of making a minibadge and should make it a lot easier. The hardest part may be deciding what design to put on your minibadge!

If you're still unsure whether you can make a minibadge, rest assured that we will be providing videos that walk you through every step! There are also many people in the community that would be more than happy to help you make your minibadge a reality. Let's all come together (virtually) to make this the year of the minibadges!

NOTE: The badge can be powered by 2 AA batteries or micro USB. It only provides power to the minibadges, no communication lines are connected.
